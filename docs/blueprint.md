1. Data Layer
1.1. Data Sources
Market Data

Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) at desired granularity (tick, 1 min, 5 min, daily).

Order Book / Level II (if you’re doing very short‐term strategies or microstructure research).

Fundamental/Alternative Data

Company financials, earnings releases, analyst estimates (for longer-term or fundamental-driven models).

News sentiment, social media feeds, macroeconomic indicators, Google Trends, or web-scraped data.

Alternative/Alternative AI Data

Satellite imagery, credit/debit card spending, shipping manifests, climate/weather data (for specific niche strategies).

1.2. Data Ingestion & Storage
Streaming vs. Batch

Real-time (low-latency) feeds for intraday/High-Frequency strategies.

Batch ingestion (e.g., nightly/weekly) for training models on historical features.

Storage

A time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) or parquet files on object storage (S3/GCS) for large volumes.

For alternative data, a relational database (Postgres/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) depending on the unstructured nature.

Data Quality & Cleanup

Handle missing timestamps, outliers, corporate actions (splits/dividends), and look-ahead bias.

Maintain a “data validation” pipeline that checks for holes, stale data, or anomalies.

2. Feature Engineering & Signal Generation
2.1. Feature Engineering
Technical Features

Moving averages (SMA, EMA), momentum (RSI, MACD), volatility (Bollinger Bands, ATR), volume‐based features.

Statistical/ML-Oriented Features

Rolling-window returns, rolling covariance/correlation, principal components (PCA) of multivariate price series.

Time-series embeddings (e.g., autoencoder bottleneck features, wavelet transforms).

Alternative Data Features

Sentiment scores from NLP models on news headlines/Twitter (e.g., fine-tuned BERT for finance).

Macroeconomic surprises (e.g., difference between consensus and actual releases).

2.2. Labeling & Target Definition
Supervised Targets

Regression: Next‐period return, log‐return, or scaler to predict price move magnitude.

Classification: Up/down move, multi-class bins (e.g., high/medium/low volatility regime).

Unsupervised/Clustering

Grouping similar assets or regime detection (e.g., market states) via k-means or Hidden Markov Models.

Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Define environment (market simulator), state (features), action (buy/sell/hold or position size), reward (PnL, risk‐adjusted metric).

3. Model Development & Training
3.1. Model Selection
Classical ML Models

Tree-based: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).

Linear Models: LASSO/Ridge, Elastic Net, logistic regression (for classification).

Deep Learning Models

Time-series architectures: LSTM, GRU, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN).

Attention-based: Transformers adapted for price sequences (e.g., Informer, Time2Vec).

Ensembles & Stacking

Combine multiple base learners (e.g., blending tree-based and neural nets) to improve robustness.

Reinforcement Learning Frameworks

PPO, DQN, DDPG, A2C with a gym-style environment that simulates trading (including transaction costs, slippage).

3.2. Training Process
Train/Validation/Test Splits

Walk-forward validation: Move a rolling window through time to train on past data, validate on the next chunk, then test on out-of-sample.

Avoid “peeking” into future data; keep strict time ordering.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Use cross-validation (time-series split) or Bayesian optimization (Optuna, Hyperopt) to tune model hyperparameters.

Evaluation Metrics

Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), directional accuracy.

Classification: Precision/Recall, ROC-AUC, F1, confusion matrix for up/down signals.

Trading‐Specific: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, profit factor, Calmar ratio.

Overfitting Prevention

Regularization, early stopping, dropout (for neural nets), and monitoring out-of-sample vs. in-sample performance gap.

4. Backtesting & Strategy Evaluation
4.1. Backtesting Engine
Tick-Level vs. Bar-Level Simulation

If you’re trading very short horizons, simulate at tick‐level including order book dynamics.

For intraday or daily, bar‐level (1 min, 5 min, daily) is often sufficient.

Transaction Cost Modeling

Account for commissions, slippage (e.g., use volume-weighted slippage models or fixed bps).

Include bid-ask spreads if using market orders.

Position Sizing & Risk Constraints

Fixed fractional: Risk a fixed percentage of equity (e.g., 1–2% per trade).

Kelly criterion: If you have return distribution models.

Maximum position limits, sector exposures, or market-cap weighting.

Portfolio Construction

If multiple signals/assets: use mean-variance optimization, risk parity, or simple equal weight.

Rebalance frequency: daily, weekly, monthly (depending on turnover objectives).

4.2. Walk-Forward Analysis
Divide your historical dataset into multiple “train → validation → test” windows.

Evaluate how model retraining frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly) impacts performance.

Record performance metrics for each fold to assess stability over different market regimes.

4.3. Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis
Stress Periods: Evaluate during 2008–2009 financial crisis, 2020 COVID drawdowns, or other regime shifts.

Monte Carlo Simulations: Randomize returns or bootstrap residuals to see distribution of potential outcomes.

5. Execution & Order Management
5.1. Integration with Broker/API
Use a reliable, low-latency API (e.g., Zerodha’s Kite Connect, Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, TD Ameritrade).

Order Types: Market, limit, stop-loss, bracket orders (for automatic exit).

Authentication & Session Management: Ensure your API keys/tokens are rotated/secured; auto-refresh sessions.

5.2. Execution Logic
Smart Order Routing (if multiple venues): Splitting orders across exchanges for best price.

Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) / Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP): For large orders to minimize market impact.

Transaction Cost Monitoring: Continuously measure realized slippage vs. expectations; feed back into models.

5.3. Latency & Fault Tolerance
Message Queue / Task Queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to decouple signal generation from order execution.

Retry Logic for API failures, network issues, or partial fills.

Graceful Shutdown: If you lose connection or if markets halt, ensure you can liquidate or pause trading safely.

6. Risk Management & Compliance
6.1. Real-Time Risk Checks
Stop-Loss / Take-Profit Gates: If open drawdown on a position reaches a threshold, close the trade.

Portfolio-Level Limits: Maximum aggregate exposure to a sector, maximum notional at risk.

Value at Risk (VaR) / Conditional VaR (CVaR): Compute rolling VaR to ensure daily VaR doesn’t exceed a threshold.

6.2. Regulatory & Audit Trail
Order Logging: Timestamped logs of every signal, order sent, modification, and execution.

Trade Blotter: Continuously updated with realized PnL, open PnL, fees, and cumulative performance.

Compliance Checks: Ensure no insider trading signals are deployed, adhere to exchange-level order restrictions (e.g., price bands, position limits).

6.3. Performance Attribution
Break down returns by model, asset class, or signal so you know which components are contributing (or detracting) from overall performance.

7. Monitoring & Deployment
7.1. Real-Time Dashboards
Metrics: Live PnL, drawdown, position exposure, key performance statistics.

Alerts/Notifications: Email/SMS/Slack alerts for exceptions (e.g., API failures, risk breaches, model underperformance).

7.2. Model Retraining & Versioning
Automated Retraining Pipeline: Periodically retrain your ML models on the newest data (e.g., weekly/monthly), then validate before promoting to production.

Model Version Control: Use Git or a model registry (MLflow) to track parameters, performance metrics, and deployments.

Canary or Shadow Deployments: Test new model versions in parallel (paper-trade) before switching over capital.

7.3. Cloud vs. On-Premise
Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure): Easier to scale compute for model training, spin up notebooks, serverless functions.

On-Premise / Co-location: For ultra-low latency strategies (HFT), you may need co-located servers near the exchange data center.

Hybrid: Train/feature-engineer in cloud; deploy inference/execution on edge or bare-metal servers.

9. Best Practices & Tips
Start Simple: Begin with one well-understood strategy (e.g., momentum with a few technical indicators) to validate your pipeline end-to-end before layering in complex ML models.

Avoid Look-Ahead Bias: Always make sure features at time t only use information available at or before t.

Walk-Forward over K-Fold: Standard K-Fold cross-validation violates time ordering; use time-series splits or expanding windows.

Robust Feature Selection: Too many features can lead to overfitting. Use methods like SHAP/LIME for interpretability and drop low-importance features.

Transaction Cost Sensitivity: Even if a model is “profitable” on gross returns, once you include realistic costs, a strategy may turn unprofitable.

Continuous Monitoring: Models can decay over time (concept drift). Set up automatic alerts when in-production model performance drops below a threshold.

Paper-Trade First: Before allocating real capital, run your framework in paper-trading mode for an extended period (at least 2–3 months) to uncover real-world edge cases.

Documentation & Reproducibility: Document data schemas, feature calculation logic, model hyperparameters, and backtesting assumptions so that everything is reproducible and audit-ready.

Modular Design: Keep components (data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, backtesting, execution) decoupled. This way you can swap in new models, data sources, or brokers without rewriting the entire codebase.

Security & Secrets Management: Store API keys, database credentials, and private keys in a secure secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) rather than hard-coding them.

Putting It All Together
A simplified workflow might look like this:

Data Ingestion Job (cron or streaming) →

Feature Engineering Pipeline (transform raw data into feature store) →

Model Training Pipeline (train/new model → validate → store in registry) →

Backtesting & Risk Analysis (run strategy over historical periods, record metrics) →

Deployment / Paper-Trade (serve model/inference endpoint → generate real-time signals) →

Execution Engine (listen to signals → send orders to broker with risk checks) →

Monitoring & Alerting (track live PnL, model drift, system health) →

Periodic Retraining (update dataset, retrain, validate, redeploy).

By adhering to this modular, well-documented approach, you’ll have a flexible framework that can incorporate new data sources, swap ML models, and scale up as needed. As you gain confidence, you can iterate by adding more advanced features—such as reinforcement learning for dynamic position sizing—or by optimizing execution with smart order routing and deeper microstructure models.
