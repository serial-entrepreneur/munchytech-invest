# Algorithmic Trading System Blueprint

## 1. Data Layer

### 1.1. Data Sources

#### Market Data
- Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) at desired granularity (tick, 1 min, 5 min, daily)
- Order Book / Level II (for short-term strategies or microstructure research)

#### Fundamental/Alternative Data
- Company financials, earnings releases, analyst estimates (for longer-term or fundamental-driven models)
- News sentiment, social media feeds, macroeconomic indicators, Google Trends, or web-scraped data

#### Alternative/AI Data
- Satellite imagery, credit/debit card spending, shipping manifests
- Climate/weather data (for specific niche strategies)

### 1.2. Data Ingestion & Storage

#### Streaming vs. Batch
- Real-time (low-latency) feeds for intraday/High-Frequency strategies
- Batch ingestion (e.g., nightly/weekly) for training models on historical features

#### Storage
- Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) or parquet files on object storage (S3/GCS) for large volumes
- For alternative data: relational database (Postgres/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) depending on the unstructured nature

#### Data Quality & Cleanup
- Handle missing timestamps, outliers, corporate actions (splits/dividends), and look-ahead bias
- Maintain a "data validation" pipeline that checks for holes, stale data, or anomalies

## 2. Feature Engineering & Signal Generation

### 2.1. Feature Engineering

#### Technical Features
- Moving averages (SMA, EMA), momentum (RSI, MACD), volatility (Bollinger Bands, ATR)
- Volume-based features

#### Statistical/ML-Oriented Features
- Rolling-window returns, rolling covariance/correlation
- Principal components (PCA) of multivariate price series
- Time-series embeddings (e.g., autoencoder bottleneck features, wavelet transforms)

#### Alternative Data Features
- Sentiment scores from NLP models on news headlines/Twitter (e.g., fine-tuned BERT for finance)
- Macroeconomic surprises (e.g., difference between consensus and actual releases)

### 2.2. Labeling & Target Definition

#### Supervised Targets
- Regression: Next-period return, log-return, or scaler to predict price move magnitude
- Classification: Up/down move, multi-class bins (e.g., high/medium/low volatility regime)

#### Unsupervised/Clustering
- Grouping similar assets or regime detection (e.g., market states) via k-means or Hidden Markov Models

#### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Define environment (market simulator), state (features), action (buy/sell/hold or position size)
- Reward (PnL, risk-adjusted metric)

## 3. Model Development & Training

### 3.1. Model Selection

#### Classical ML Models
- Tree-based: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- Linear Models: LASSO/Ridge, Elastic Net, logistic regression (for classification)

#### Deep Learning Models
- Time-series architectures: LSTM, GRU, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
- Attention-based: Transformers adapted for price sequences (e.g., Informer, Time2Vec)

#### Ensembles & Stacking
- Combine multiple base learners (e.g., blending tree-based and neural nets) to improve robustness

#### Reinforcement Learning Frameworks
- PPO, DQN, DDPG, A2C with a gym-style environment that simulates trading
- Include transaction costs, slippage

### 3.2. Training Process

#### Train/Validation/Test Splits
- Walk-forward validation: Move a rolling window through time
- Avoid "peeking" into future data; keep strict time ordering

#### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use cross-validation (time-series split) or Bayesian optimization (Optuna, Hyperopt)
- Tune model hyperparameters

#### Evaluation Metrics
- Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), directional accuracy
- Classification: Precision/Recall, ROC-AUC, F1, confusion matrix for up/down signals
- Trading-Specific: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, profit factor, Calmar ratio

#### Overfitting Prevention
- Regularization, early stopping, dropout (for neural nets)
- Monitor out-of-sample vs. in-sample performance gap

## 4. Backtesting & Strategy Evaluation

### 4.1. Backtesting Engine

#### Tick-Level vs. Bar-Level Simulation
- Tick-level simulation for short horizons, including order book dynamics
- Bar-level (1 min, 5 min, daily) for intraday or daily strategies

#### Transaction Cost Modeling
- Account for commissions, slippage (volume-weighted or fixed bps)
- Include bid-ask spreads for market orders

#### Position Sizing & Risk Constraints
- Fixed fractional: Risk a fixed percentage of equity (e.g., 1-2% per trade)
- Kelly criterion: For return distribution models
- Maximum position limits, sector exposures, or market-cap weighting

#### Portfolio Construction
- Multiple signals/assets: mean-variance optimization, risk parity, or simple equal weight
- Rebalance frequency: daily, weekly, monthly (depending on turnover objectives)

### 4.2. Walk-Forward Analysis
- Divide historical dataset into multiple "train → validation → test" windows
- Evaluate model retraining frequency impact (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Record performance metrics for each fold to assess stability

### 4.3. Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis
- Stress Periods: 2008-2009 financial crisis, 2020 COVID drawdowns, or other regime shifts
- Monte Carlo Simulations: Randomize returns or bootstrap residuals

## 5. Execution & Order Management

### 5.1. Integration with Broker/API
- Use reliable, low-latency API (e.g., Zerodha's Kite Connect, Interactive Brokers, Alpaca)
- Order Types: Market, limit, stop-loss, bracket orders
- Authentication & Session Management: Secure API keys/tokens, auto-refresh sessions

### 5.2. Execution Logic
- Smart Order Routing: Split orders across exchanges for best price
- VWAP/TWAP: Minimize market impact for large orders
- Transaction Cost Monitoring: Measure realized slippage vs. expectations

### 5.3. Latency & Fault Tolerance
- Message Queue / Task Queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Retry Logic for API failures, network issues, or partial fills
- Graceful Shutdown: Safe liquidation or pause trading

## 6. Risk Management & Compliance

### 6.1. Real-Time Risk Checks
- Stop-Loss / Take-Profit Gates: Close trades at threshold drawdowns
- Portfolio-Level Limits: Maximum sector exposure, notional risk
- Value at Risk (VaR) / Conditional VaR (CVaR): Monitor daily risk limits

### 6.2. Regulatory & Audit Trail
- Order Logging: Timestamped logs of signals, orders, modifications, executions
- Trade Blotter: Track realized PnL, open PnL, fees, performance
- Compliance Checks: Prevent insider trading, adhere to exchange restrictions

### 6.3. Performance Attribution
- Break down returns by model, asset class, or signal
- Identify contributing or detracting components

## 7. Monitoring & Deployment

### 7.1. Real-Time Dashboards
- Metrics: Live PnL, drawdown, position exposure, performance statistics
- Alerts/Notifications: Email/SMS/Slack for exceptions

### 7.2. Model Retraining & Versioning
- Automated Retraining Pipeline: Periodic updates with validation
- Model Version Control: Track parameters, metrics, deployments
- Canary/Shadow Deployments: Test new versions before capital allocation

### 7.3. Cloud vs. On-Premise
