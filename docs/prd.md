Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the design and development roadmap for an AI/ML-driven algorithmic trading framework. The system will ingest market, order book, and fundamental data; store and validate them; generate comprehensive features; support multiple targets for diverse analyses; and evolve through version-wise increments. It leverages:

Market & Order Book Data via Zerodha’s Kite Connect

Fundamental Data via Screener API

Time-Series Storage in Parquet (PySpark)

Alternative Data Storage in PostgreSQL & MongoDB

Manual Missing-Data Handling and Data Validation

Comprehensive Feature Engineering using all major Python libraries

Multiple Targets (regression, classification, clustering, RL)

Objectives
Establish a robust data pipeline that ingests, stores, and validates raw market, order book, and fundamental data.

Implement end-to-end feature engineering using industry-standard libraries to derive technical, statistical, and alternative features.

Support multiple analytical targets (e.g., next-period return prediction, directional classification, regime clustering, RL-based position sizing).

Versioned delivery roadmap allowing iterative enhancements: start with basic ingestion & storage, then add validation, feature generation, and multi-target capabilities.

Stakeholders
Quantitative Researchers & Data Scientists: Define feature sets, targets, and algorithms.

Backend Engineers (Data Platform Team): Build ingestion, storage, and validation pipelines.

DevOps/Infrastructure: Provision and maintain cloud resources, scheduling, containerization.

Product Manager: Prioritize feature roadmap, coordinate between teams.

QA & Compliance: Ensure data quality, auditability, and regulatory compliance.

Technical Architecture & Components
1. Data Ingestion Layer
Sources & APIs:

Market Data (OHLCV)
• Source: Kite Connect REST/WebSocket endpoints
• Frequency: Tick-level (optional), 1 min, 5 min bars

Order Book Data (Level II)
• Source: Kite Connect WebSocket (depth‐of‐book updates)
• Frequency: Real-time (as pushed by Kite)

Fundamental Data
• Source: Screener API (e.g., quarterly financials, ratios, corporate actions)
• Frequency: Batch (daily/weekly updates)

Ingestion Infrastructure:

Batch Framework
• Apache Airflow or Prefect to schedule daily/nightly pulls of historical OHLCV and fundamental snapshots.
• PySpark jobs (Spark SQL) to transform raw JSON/CSV into standardized Parquet partitions.

Real-Time/Streaming
• A lightweight Python service (e.g., using kiteconnect library) subscribes to WebSocket streams for order book & tick data.
• Data is pushed into Kafka or AWS Kinesis for immediate downstream processing (if real-time features are required).

Requirements:

Authenticate with Kite Connect (API key/secret, access token refresh).

Gracefully handle API rate limits & reconnect logic (exponential backoff).

Log ingestion success/failure, batch run times, and record counts.

2. Data Storage Layer
Time-Series Storage (Parquet + PySpark):

Raw Parquet
• Landing zone: Raw JSON/CSV to HDFS/S3-like object store.
• “Bronze” tables: Unprocessed OHLCV and order book data in Parquet (partitioned by date/instrument).

Cleaned Parquet (Silver/Gold):
• Silver: After missing-value imputation & basic validation, store cleaned Parquet tables.
• Gold: Enriched time-series (merged OHLCV + order book + adjusted for splits/dividends).

Schema Considerations:
• instrument_token, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume, plus depth fields (bid_price_1, bid_qty_1, ask_price_1, ask_qty_1, …).
• Parquet partitioning by year, month, day, and optionally instrument_token for efficient queries.

Alternative Data Storage:

PostgreSQL (Relational):
• Fundamental tables (quarterly/annual financials, ratios, corporate actions).
• Index on symbol or instrument_token, and report_date.

MongoDB (NoSQL / Document):
• Semi-structured alternative data (news sentiment JSON, social media feeds, macroeconomic releases).
• Collections: news_sentiment, social_media_sentiment, macroeconomic_indicators.
• Document schema allows for flexible fields (e.g., nested sentiment scores, source metadata).

3. Data Validation & Missing Data Handling
Manual Missing-Data Handling:

Detection:
• For each time-series table, run a PySpark validation job to detect:
– Missing timestamps (gaps in continuous series)
– Null or zero volumes at unusual times
– Outliers (e.g., price spikes/drops > Xσ from rolling mean)
• Log anomalies in a separate “Data Quality Report” (Parquet or relational table).

Imputation Strategies (Manual):
• For short gaps (< n minutes): Forward fill (ffill) and backward fill (bfill) in PySpark DataFrame.
• For longer gaps or missing days: Mark as “market holiday” if consistent; otherwise, fill with nearest available closing price or drop if outside tolerance.
• Document assumptions and keep a record of imputations (audit trail).

Preliminary Validation Checks:

Schema Compliance: Ensure each data source ingested matches the expected schema (data types, column count).

Basic Sanity Checks:
• OHLC: high ≥ max(open, close), low ≤ min(open, close)
• Volume: Non-negative, non-zero for trading hours
• Order Book: Bid price ≤ ask price

Automated Validation Pipelines:
• Use Great Expectations (or a custom PySpark validation library) for rule-based checks.
• Schedule validation jobs immediately after ingestion; send alerts (email/Slack) on failures.

4. Feature Engineering Layer
Leverage all major Python libraries to generate technical, statistical, and alternative features. Maintain modularity so new libraries can be plugged in.

Primary Libraries & Tools:

pandas & PySpark DataFrame: Core transformations, rolling windows.

NumPy: Efficient numeric operations.

TA-Lib: Standard technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.).

pandas_ta: Additional or customized technical indicators.

tsfresh: Automated extraction of time-series features (e.g., Fourier coefficients, entropy, autocorrelation).

Featuretools: Automated “Deep Feature Synthesis” for relational data – useful to combine OHLCV, order book, and fundamental tables.

scikit-learn:
• Standard scaling, PCA, clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN), feature selection (SelectKBest, Lasso).

PyOD: Outlier detection features for regime identification.

NLTK / spaCy: For text cleaning if news/sentiment data is pulled.

Transformers (Hugging Face): Fine-tune BERT or FinBERT models to generate sentiment embeddings from headlines or social feeds.

NetworkX (optional): Compute graph-based features if constructing correlation networks between assets.

Feature Categories & Examples:

Technical Features (Bar-Level)

Moving Averages: SMA_5, SMA_10, EMA_12, EMA_26

Momentum: RSI_14, MACD (12,26,9), Stochastic Oscillator %K/%D

Volatility: Bollinger_Band_Width, ATR_14

Volume: OBV, VWAP, volume_zscore (volume − rolling_mean(volume)) / rolling_std(volume)

Order-Book Microstructure Features

Bid‐ask spread: ask_1_price − bid_1_price

Order pressure: (sum(bid_qty_1..n) − sum(ask_qty_1..n)) / (sum(bid_qty_1..n) + sum(ask_qty_1..n))

Depth imbalance over rolling windows (e.g., 5‐minute avg imbalance)

Book slope: Linear regression of price vs. cumulative quantity on bid/ask side

Statistical/Time-Series Features

Rolling returns: log(close_t / close_{t−n}) for n ∈ {1,5,15,30,60 min}

Rolling volatility: rolling_std(log returns) over 15/30/60/240 min

Correlation/Covariance: rolling correlation between two instruments (e.g., NIFTY vs. BANKNIFTY)

PCA features: Principal component scores on multivariate price series (e.g., first 3 PCs every day)

tsfresh features: time-series entropy, sample entropy, autocorrelation lag 1/2/…/n, continuous wavelet transform coefficients

Fundamental Features

Valuation Ratios: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA (quarterly update)

Profitability: ROE, ROA, Net Profit Margin

Growth: YoY revenue growth, QoQ EBITDA growth

Liquidity: Current ratio, quick ratio

Leverage: Debt/Equity, Interest Coverage

Featuretools can join these table-based features with bar-level data on the “symbol + date” key.

Alternative/NLP-Based Features

Sentiment Score: FinBERT or custom Transformer output on daily headlines

Volume of Mentions: Count of tweets/news articles per symbol per hour/day

Macroeconomic Surprise Index: (Actual − Consensus)/Consensus scaled for each release

Featuretools can fuse news features with OHLCV by timestamp alignment.

Portfolio/Risk Features

Rolling VaR (5% or 1%) of returns

Rolling portfolio beta (if trading multiple assets)

Drawdown metrics: max drawdown over 1-day, 5-day, 20-day rolling windows

Implementation Considerations:

Implement feature extraction in PySpark UDFs or vectorized pandas calls depending on data volume.

Cache intermediate features (e.g., rolling averages) to avoid recomputation.

Maintain a centralized “Feature Registry” (e.g., Delta tables) documenting feature definitions, parameters, and data types.

Version features alongside code (Git tags) to ensure reproducibility.

5. Target Generation Layer
The framework will generate multiple target types for different downstream analyses:

Regression Targets:

Next-Period Return: $\text{ret}{t+1} = \ln\bigl(\frac{\text{close}{t+1}}{\text{close}_t}\bigr)$ (1 min, 5 min, 1 hour, daily).

Log-Scaled Movement: $\ln(\text{high}{t+1}/\text{low}{t+1})$ (proxy for volatility).

Classification Targets:

Direction: Binary (Up/Down) if $\text{close}_{t+δ} − \text{close}_t > θ$ (e.g., θ = 0.1% return).

Volatility Regime: Low/Medium/High (e.g., quantify realized volatility over next hour; discretize into tertiles).

Spread Explosion: Binary indicator if bid-ask spread widens beyond μ + 2σ of historical rolling.

Clustering/Unsupervised Labels:

Regime Clusters: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or KMeans on rolling returns & volatility features to label market states (Bull, Bear, Sideways).

Asset Grouping: Cluster instruments by correlation profile (e.g., cluster NIFTY sector constituents).

Reinforcement Learning Environment & Rewards:

State: Vector of features at time t (technical + order-book + fundamental).

Action Space: {-1, 0, +1} or continuous [-1,1] representing short/flat/long positions or position size.

Reward: Realized PnL at end of next interval minus transaction cost. Can also consider risk-adjusted reward (e.g., Sharpe over rolling window).

Episode Definition: Standard trading day, with terminal reward equal to end-of-day PnL.

Storage of Targets:

Save targets alongside features in “Gold” Parquet tables:
• A unified table schema:

text
Copy
Edit
instrument_token | timestamp | feature_vector_id | reg_ret_1min | dir_label_1min | vol_regime_1hour | cluster_state | rl_reward_t+1
Maintain separate tables for each target type if they vary in frequency (e.g., hourly vs. daily).

6. Backtesting & Performance Analytics (Early Version)
While not the primary focus in early versions, an initial backtesting harness is required to validate generated features/targets:

Backtesting Engine:
• Use a lightweight Python backtester (e.g., Backtrader or a custom vectorized engine) that can consume Parquet feature/target tables.
• Simulate simple strategies: e.g., “if classification model predicts Up next bar, go long 1 unit; else flat.”
• Include simple trading cost model (fixed bps slippage + commission).

Performance Metrics:
• Gross & Net PnL, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, profit factor.
• Rolling performance (monthly, quarterly).
• Confusion matrix and classification report if using classifiers.

Walk-Forward Analysis:
• Split historical data into train/valid/test windows (e.g., 1 year train, 3 months valid, 3 months test).
• Automate rolling forward the window and record out-of-sample metrics.

Reporting:
• Generate PDF/HTML reports with Matplotlib charts: equity curve, drawdown plot, feature importances.
• Store reports in an S3 bucket or shared network drive.

7. Monitoring, Deployment & CI/CD
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
