# Development Log

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Data Ingestion Layer

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup
- Created initial project structure following blueprint
- Set up poetry for dependency management
- Added core dependencies for data ingestion

### Current Status
- Working on: Data Ingestion Layer
- Next Steps: Implement Kite Connect integration
- Completed: Project structure setup

### Features Implemented
- None yet (Project initialization phase)

### Features Pending
1. Data Ingestion Layer
   - Kite Connect integration
   - Data validation
   - Storage setup
2. Feature Engineering
3. Target Generation
4. ML Training Pipelines
5. Evaluation & Testing
6. Real-time Trading Loop
7. Dashboard

### Step 2: Project Structure Refactor
- Moved all main project directories (data_ingestion, data_validation, feature_engineering, target_generation, models, notebooks, tests, config, utils, docker) inside a new module directory named mt_inv for better modularity and namespace management.

### Step 3: Data Ingestion Feature Implementation
- Started implementing the data ingestion feature as per the PRD.
- Focus on integrating Kite Connect for market data ingestion.
- Next steps include setting up authentication, handling API rate limits, and logging ingestion success/failure.

### Step 4: Unit Testing for Kite Connect Integration
- Created unit tests for the Kite Connect integration module in `mt_inv/tests/unit/test_kite_connect_integration.py`.
- Tests cover authentication success and failure, as well as fetching historical data success and failure scenarios.
